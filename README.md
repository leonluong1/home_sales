# Home Sales Data Analysis
Module 22 Big Data Challenge -- Berkeley Data Analytics Boot Camp

This project is about examining home sales over time using PySpark and SparkSQL. We have a Jupyter Notebook file that contains starter code. 

## Project Description
This project is meant to test my PySpark and SparkSQL knowledge. I created a PySpark dataframe and temporary table using the home_sales_revisited csv. Then, I created a series of sql queries using SparkSQL. Finally, I compared the runtime of these queries with the cached version of the table and parquet/partitioned version of the tables.

The file types in this repository are ipynb, csv and md files.
